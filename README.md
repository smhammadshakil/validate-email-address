## Overview

This repository contains a Go-based email validation tool. The tool validates email addresses in multiple stages:
1. **Format Validation**: Ensures the email has a valid format.
2. **Domain Validation**: Checks the domain's DNS records, including MX, SPF, and DMARC.
3. **SMTP Validation**: Connects to the domain's mail server to verify the email address.

This program provides robust email validation, making it ideal for developers looking to verify email addresses before processing them further.
